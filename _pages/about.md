Hi! I'm **Zihan (Tina) Zhang**, a graduate student in **Statistics at Columbia University**.  
My research interests lie in **causal inference**, **health data analysis**, and **computational social science**.

Iâ€™m passionate about using data to uncover insights that inform policy and improve lives.  
My experience spans causal analysis with real-world datasets, health outcome modeling, and large-scale data integration.

Outside of research, I enjoy building models from scratch, cleaning messy data, and making statistical methods work in applied settings.
